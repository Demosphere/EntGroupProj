##Week 9
###3/25/16

###3/28/16

Completed:
* Setup database on OpenShift
* Created entities for all database tables (users, user_roles, user_roles pk, sites)
* Create UsersEntityDao, UsersEntityDaoWithHibernate, UsersEntityDaoWithHibernateTest
* Unsuccessfully attempted to connect to database hosted on OpenShift

###4/9/16

Completed:
* Setup associations between entities, and created unit tests to test the associations. This took longer than I expected, as I needed to do a lot of research to figure out how to associate entities. 

###4/11/16

Completed:
* Attempted to deploy application, both locally and to Openshift. This was very unsuccessful. We decided to scale back our project, and hopefully will get the project deployed tomorrow.
